# Python-With-IA-Starting

#### 1- Introduction: 
This chapter will provide how the content is organized and how to learn to program with python with the help of artificial intelligence. Also included will be a brief description of why Python is a popular programming language and the areas where it is commonly used.

#### 2- First steps of Learning Python with AI: 
In this chapter, we will discuss the necessary tools to start programming in python. Likewise, once presented, the first steps for programming will be carried out with the help of artificial intelligence to achieve it.

#### 3- First steps with programming:
In this chapter, students will learn the basic concepts of programming in Python, with the most common variables, operators and declarations.

#### 4- Variables and Data Types: 
In this chapter, students will delve into data types in Python, such as numbers, strings, lists, and dictionaries, and how to work with them in programs.

#### 5- Control Flow Structures: 
In this chapter, students will learn about control flow structures in Python, such as if-else, for, and while loops, and how to use them to control the flow of execution of their programs.

#### 6- Functions: 
In this chapter, students will learn about functions in Python and how to create and use their own functions. They will also be taught about recursion and how to use it in their programs.

#### 7- Modules and Packages: 
In this chapter, students will be taught how to import and use modules and packages in Python to extend the functionality of their programs.

#### 8- Files: 
In this chapter, students will be taught how to work with files in Python, including how to read and write files and how to handle errors and exceptions.

#### 9- OOP in Python: 
In this chapter, students will be introduced to object-oriented programming in Python and how to create and use classes and objects in their programs.

#### 10- Creating a finance web page with Python: 
In this chapter, students will learn how to create a finance web page using Python and some popular web libraries like Flask or Django.
