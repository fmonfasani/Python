# Python-With-IA-Starting

1-Introduction: This chapter will provide a general introduction to Python and its use in artificial intelligence. 
A brief description of why Python is a popular programming language and the areas where it is commonly used will be included.


2-Getting started with Python and AI: In this chapter, students will be guided through the installation of Python and some of 
the most common libraries used in artificial intelligence, such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow.

3-Getting started with programming: In this chapter, students will be introduced to the basic concepts of programming in Python, 
such as variables, operators, and statements.

4-Variables and data types: In this chapter, students will delve into the data types in Python, such as numbers, strings, lists, 
and dictionaries, and how to work with them in programs.

5-Flow control structures: In this chapter, students will be taught about the flow control structures in Python, such as if-else, 
for and while loops, and how to use them to control the execution flow of their programs.

6-Functions: In this chapter, students will be introduced to functions in Python and how to create and use their own functions. 
They will also be taught about recursion and how to use it in their programs.

7-Modules and packages: In this chapter, students will be taught how to import and use modules and packages in Python to extend 
the functionality of their programs.

8-Files: In this chapter, students will be taught how to work with files in Python, including how to read and write files and how 
to handle errors and exceptions.

9-OOP in Python: In this chapter, students will be introduced to object-oriented programming in Python and how to create and use classes 
and objects in their programs.

10-Creating a finance web page with Python: In this chapter, students will learn how to create a finance web page using Python and some 
popular web libraries such as Flask or Django.
